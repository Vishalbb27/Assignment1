The Medicare project aims to develop a web application with a user portal and an admin portal, using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The sprints are divided into four weeks. The first sprint focuses on setting up the project and creating the user portal, including features like sign-in, search medicine, and filters. In the second sprint, an admin portal is developed to manage medicines, allowing admins to add, remove, and edit medicine details. The third sprint focuses on implementing cart functionality and integrating a payment portal for secure transactions. The final sprint involves deploying the application on an Amazon EC2 instance using Docker and creating a confirmation page for successful transactions. Throughout the sprints, attention is given to authentication, authorization, data validation, and error handling to ensure a robust and secure application.
